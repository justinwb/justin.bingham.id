## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="assets/images/jwb.png">

I've spent the better part of this millenium [starting and running 
companies](work-history), while architecting and building some interesting tech 
along the way. I've had a bit of success,
a bit of luck, and a lot of fun with a bunch of good people.

I started my career right out of high school with a [focus on network security](work-history#work-intrusic), 
subsequently inventing one of the first systems to detect sophisticated covert 
channels over a network, alongside a diverse software delivery team and next-level 
R&D group that I built and led.

I co-founded a [professional-services firm](work-history#work-jd-services) 
focused on delivering mission critical
software that grew organically for over a decade up to a successful exit.
I grew and managed cross-functional teams across the world, building solutions 
across a range of technology stacks and industry verticals, and stood up
multiple international delivery centers to provide additional capacity.
I also led the creation of a software framework licensed by our customers 
to rapidly create scalable applications that was instrumental in our
recognition as a [Gartner Cool Vendor](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170518005703/en/Janeiro-Digital-Named-a-Business-and-IT-Services-Cool-Vendor-by-Gartner).

I've spent time applying [decentralized](decentralized) patterns and protocols
to real-world problems, and maintain a role
as [co-editor](https://github.com/solid/process/blob/main/editors.md) of the 
[Solid Project](https://solidproject.org) with the 
inventor of the Web, [Sir Tim Berners-Lee](https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/).
My team created one of the [first commercial systems](work-history#work-jd-decentralized) to 
integrate enterprise infrastructure
with decentralized data, counting the UK [National Health Service](https://nhs.uk)
as an early customer, while collaborating with visionary organizations like
[RSA Labs](https://www.janeirodigital.com/blog/new-partnership-brings-enterprise-security-to-the-decentralized-web/).
This work was recently cited in 
[Data Saves Lives](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-saves-lives-reshaping-health-and-social-care-with-data-draft/data-saves-lives-reshaping-health-and-social-care-with-data-draft#case-study-personal-data-stores),
a policy paper led by the UK Minister of Health on the essential role of data in 
the future of the UK's health strategy.

I've given talks on myriad subjects across the world; from scalable application 
architecture and network security to decentralization and digital identity; 
including @ [SXSW](https://schedule.sxsw.com/2019/speakers/2011886), 
MIT [CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/), the 
Fast Company [Innovation Summit](https://events.fastcompany.com/innovationfestival19/speakers), 
Harvard [Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society](https://cyber.harvard.edu/), 
BU [Questrom School of Business](https://www.bu.edu/questrom/),
the [RSA Security Conference](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210512005319/en/Identity-Experts-to-Reveal-How-Organizations-Can-Thrive-in-the-Digital-World-at-RSA-Conference), 
and the MIT [Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/). 

I'm an engineer at heart. I love to make things, and I love building teams of
smart and relentless makers that enjoy the process as much as I do.

I live north of Boston, MA with my wife, my two little girls, and a fluffy, killer dog.

## Random Bits

* Ten years ago I decided to spend a year working remotely, and travel around
  the country in a Jeep with my dog. I had a goal to hit every off-road spot I
  could find. Before I knew it, I'd amassed
  [100,000 followers](https://www.facebook.com/feedthewheels), made friends
  all over the country, got a dozen sponsors
  (including [Teraflex](https://teraflex.com), [Borla Exhaust](https://borla.com),
  [Rebel Off-Road](https://rebeloffroad.com), and
  [Magnuson Superchargers](https://magnusonsuperchargers.com/)), and rebuilt
  my Jeep twice.

* I was honored to be nominated and
  [unanimously approved](https://middletonma.gov/CivicMedia?VID=363)
  by my town's Board of Selectmen to be an [Election Registrar](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleVIII/Chapter51/Section15). 
  As a long-time independent who believes that free and fair elections are
  the bedrock of our representative democracy, I'm grateful for the opportunity
  to serve my community in this capacity.

* I made a [tool](http://loghog.sourceforge.net/) at my first tech job
  straight out of high school to help me keep track of intrusion detection events.
  Years later I realized it was being featured in books and articles.
