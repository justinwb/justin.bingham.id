## Work History

Wearing all kinds of hats over the years has given me a diverse skill set 
and a whole lot of perspective. I've learned from
enough of my failures to appreciate my successes, and that my best skill
is being able to work backward from real-world problems to
solutions that move the needle for a business, industry, or community,
and creating collaborative, high-performing teams to realize them.

#### Decentralized Software
{: #work-jd-decentralized}

**2018 - Present**

After identifying the need for new decentralized integration patterns to
connect decentralized and centralized ecosystems, I conceived and architected
[XFORM](https://www.janeirodigital.com/xform/). XFORM is a software platform 
that seamlessly integrates decentralized 
ecosystems with the rest of the world (and each other). Incubated within my 
[professional services business](#work-jd-services), we spun it out in 2021.
As CTO I'm responsible for composing and growing the entire technology
organization, managing the product roadmap, and providing full architectural 
oversight of the product portfolio.

- [XFORM](https://www.janeirodigital.com/xform/) is one of the 
  first commercial systems to integrate enterprise applications and systems with 
  decentralized data, protocols, and identities.
- Early customers include UK [National Health Service](https://nhs.uk),
  [Zurich Insurance](https://www.zurich.com/), and [Novartis](https://novartis.com) 
- Partnerships with [RSA Labs](https://www.janeirodigital.com/blog/new-partnership-brings-enterprise-security-to-the-decentralized-web/), 
  [Inrupt](https://inrupt.com), [KPMG](https://home.kpmg/), and [Deloitte](https://www.deloitte.com/)

#### Professional Services

**2008 - 2021**

I co-founded Janeiro Digital in 2009; a professional services business that
specialized in building massively scalable, data-intensive systems and
applications. Overseeing the global technology team, 
I built and managed a high-performing organization with offices 
in the US and across the world, and pioneered our RADD methodology for the precise delivery of mission-critical 
enterprise software. We grew it organically from day one through a successful exit in 2021.

We delivered massive products across a range of industries,
from financial trading systems managing billions of dollars to a monitoring
and diagnostic system ensuring the safe generation and distribution of nuclear,
wind, natural gas, and clean coal for the largest independent generator of
energy in the United States.

* 100% organic growth from day one to a successful exit in 2021
* Built and grew teams in US, Central America, South America, and Europe
* Established a commercial framework of reusable software components that was 
  utilized across our customer engagements.

### Systems Engineer @ Shore.net 
{: #work-shorenet}

**1998 - 2001**

My first job in tech, which I started while in high school as a customer support
technician. Ultimately became responsible for managing, securing, and monitoring 
the service provider network. I used and expanded on a range of
open-source tools available at the time. I was able to identify some key problems 
in securing large networks that led to the founding of my first startup.
