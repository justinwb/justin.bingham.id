## Work History

I started my career out of high-school [focusing on network security](#work-intrusic), 
subsequently inventing one of the first systems to detect sophisticated covert channels over a network. 
After that, I co-founded a professional-services [tech firm](#work-jd) that grew
organically for over a decade up to a successful exit. We subsequently spun out 
a new [decentralized software startup](#work-jd-decentralized) (albeit under
the same brand) that we'd incubated since 2018.

#### Decentralized Software : 2018 - Present
{: #work-jd-decentralized}

Our revolutionary [XFORM](https://www.janeirodigital.com/xform/) platform seamlessly integrates decentralized 
ecosystems with the rest of the world (and each other). Incubated within my 
[professional services business](#work-jd-services), we spun it out in 2021.
As CTO I'm responsible for the product roadmap, system architecture, and 
execution of the software delivery team.

- [XFORM](https://www.janeirodigital.com/xform/) is one of the 
  first commercial systems to integrate enterprise applications and systems with 
  decentralized data, protocols, and identities.
- Early customers include UK [National Health Service](https://nhs.uk),
  [Zurich Insurance](https://www.zurich.com/), and [Novartis](https://novartis.com) 
- Partnerships with [RSA Labs](https://www.janeirodigital.com/blog/new-partnership-brings-enterprise-security-to-the-decentralized-web/), 
  [Inrupt](https://inrupt.com), [KPMG](https://home.kpmg/), and [Deloitte](https://www.deloitte.com/)

#### Professional Services : 2008 - 2021
{: #work-jd-services}

I co-founded Janeiro Digital in 2009; a professional services business that
specialized in building massively scalable, data intensive systems and
applications for large enterprises. Overseeing the technology and creative divisions, 
I pioneered our RADD methodology for precise delivery of mission-critical 
software. We grew it organically from day one through a successful exit in 2021.

### Systems Engineer @ Shore.net : 1998 - 2001
{: #work-shorenet}

My first job in tech, which I started while in high-school. Ultimately 
responsible for managing, securing, and monitoring the service provider network. 
I used and expanded on a range of
open-source tools available at the time. I was able to identify some key problems 
in securing large networks that led to the founding of my first startup.
