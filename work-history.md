## Work History

I started my career right out of high-school with a [focus on network security](#work-intrusic), 
subsequently inventing one of the first systems to detect sophisticated covert channels over a network. 
After that, I co-founded a [professional-services firm](#work-jd) focused on
delivering mission-critical enterprise software, which grew
organically for over a decade up to a successful exit. We subsequently spun out 
a [decentralized software startup](#work-jd-decentralized) (albeit under
the same brand) that we'd incubated since 2018.

Wearing all kinds of hats over the years has given me a diverse skillset 
and a whole lot of perspective. 

* I've been a developer churning out code to hit critical product deadlines
  in just about every major language and operating environment.

* I've led teams and architected massive systems across a range of industries,
  from financial trading systems managing billions of dollars, to a monitoring
  and diagnostic system ensuring the safe generation and distribution of nuclear, 
  wind, natural gas, and clean coal for the largest independent generator of 
  energy in the United States.

* I've worked the phones for hours on end in [customer support](#work-shorenet).

* I've been the technical ringer for sales teams, marrying business needs to
  technical solutions on the fly, turning leads into opportunities, and providing
  the concrete guidance and strategy needed to move deals across the line
  with some of the biggest and most innovative companies in the world.

* I've authored, edited, and implemented [open standards](decentralized) for
  decentralized Web3 ecosystems.

* I [led a research team](#work-intrusic) of PhDs, cryptographers, astrophysicists, and 
  reformed hackers, and came up with novel ways to detect covert channels
  in encrypted communication streams.

* I've modified opens source kernels to [optimize data processing](#work-intrusic).

* I've seen good ideas and great technologies fail because the market wasn't ready 
  for them, because timing is everything.
  
* I've [raised](#work-intrusic) millions of dollars 
  from top-tier venture capital firms, and I've grown companies [organically](#work-jd) 
  that generated millions of dollars in annual revenue from nothing. 

I've learned from
enough of my failures to appreciate my successes, and that my best skill
is being able to work backwards from real-world problems to
solutions that move the needle for a business, industry, or community.

### Systems Engineer @ Shore.net 
{: #work-shorenet}

**1998 - 2001**

My first job in tech, which I started while in high-school as a customer support
technician. Ultimately became responsible for managing, securing, and monitoring 
the service provider network. I used and expanded on a range of
open-source tools available at the time. I was able to identify some key problems 
in securing large networks that led to the founding of my first startup.
